### Michal Smyk

--------------------------------------------
I am an autodidact with a passion for problem-solving. During the 2020 lockdown, I started coding for fun and
this hobby has led me to do a Software Engineering bootcamp with Makers Academy in 2022. My
background has shaped me into a versatile professional, equipped with a unique skill set ideal for
tech-oriented roles. I'm fascinated by how software functions and I enjoy developing applications to simplify
everyday tasks. With proven leadership and communication skills, honed from prior customer service and
team management roles, I am prepared to contribute to software engineering. Committed to continuous
learning, I am excited to bring my capabilities to a new career in the tech industry

### Education 
#### Makers Academy Nov '22 - March '23

As a graduate of the highly selective and intense Makers Academy Software Engineering Bootcamp, I have strengthened my
programming skills through learning various concepts such as __TDD, OOP, pair programming and agile development__. 

* __Test Driven Development__ : With a strong focus on __TDD__ practices, I approach problem-solving by writing automated tests
before writing code. This methodology helps me to build reliable software that meets the requirements and
specifications.
* __Self-learning__: I am adept at self-learning, and I take the initiative to continuously improve my skill set. Through the
course, which was mostly self-lead, I developed a strong sense of self-discipline and resourcefulness .
* __Strategic thinking__: I am well-versed in __SOLID__ and __OPP__ principles and I leverage this knowledge to write cleaner, more
maintainable code. My strategic thinking skills help me to plant and prioritise my work, ensuring that I deliver a highquality software on time.
* __Agile development__: I have a deep understanding of the agile development methodology, having worked on several
engineering projects during the course. I am comfortable working in an agile environment, collaborating with team
members, and delivering value to end-user in an iterative and incremental manner.
* __Leadership__: Using my exceptional soft skills, I am confident in leading stand-ups, retrospectives, and projects
presentations. I have experience in managing teams, communicating effectively, and driving the project to success.
* __Designed__ and build 20+ web applications starting with Ruby and JavaScript
* __Collaborated__ in Agile teams with focus on __XP__ values, pair-programming, __CI/CD__ and __Git workflow__
* Created an app Solved, a treasure hunting game for tourists. Utilised Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React Native. Used
RESTful API, unit testing in Jest.

### Work Experience

### Retaurant Manager, Longrain Jul 2021 - Aug 2022 

* __Organisational effectiveness__: I ensured that I can be counted on to achieve results in high pressure situations. 

* __Efficiency__: I set and used the table planning option in the booking system to handle bookings and tables in a more
efficient way and helped to manage daily tasks. 
* __Collaborating__ with designers: I liaised with a designer to optimise the food and drinks menu to eliminate confusion to
customers by adding a layout, and established a clear and meaningful criteria bases on most sold items and those with
the highest profit margin for the effective performance
* __Problem-solving__: I reduced the workload of the waiting staff and the confusion in the kitchen by installing a printer in
the server/pass area to print the orders as soon as the order is made. Customer service improved as waiting staff can
focus on customers and plates arrive on time to the whole table at once. 
* __Cost reduction__: I implemented cost-saving measures by optimising staff scheduling and reducing personnel costs. This
involved a hands-on approach to managing payroll system ( saving Â£250 a month ) and gaining a deeper understanding
of the efficient utilization of personnel.


### Breakfast Chef, Coalition           May 2021 - Jul 2021

* __Work under pressure__: I demonstrated ability to handle high-pressure situations by successfully preparing for and
managing busy service periods in a high-volume restaurant on Brighton seafront

expectations during high-pressure situations. Demonstrated the ability to prioritise tasks and manage competing
demands, contributing to the smooth and efficient functioning of the restaurant


  
### Breakfast chef, Breakfast at Tiffany's         Nov 2020 - May 2021

* __Self-management__: Strong self-management skills demonstrated through the ability to independently open and close
the restaurant, manage service, and maintain food quality, even while working alone.

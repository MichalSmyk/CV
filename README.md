I am courius and analytical with common sense. Thanks to the different work places I have worked with, I became versatile to adapt myself to the different ways of work; gaining transferable skills help me to bring 'innovation' to new work places. As someone who loves learning new things and needs to stay busy at all time I find software developing world perceft for me.

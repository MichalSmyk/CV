As a graduate of the highly selective and intense Makers Academy Software Engineering Bootcamp, I have strengthened my
programming skills through learning various concepts such as TDD, OOP, pair programming and agile development.

before writing code. This methodology helps me to build reliable software that meets the requirements and
specifications.

course, which was mostly self-lead, I developed a strong sense of self-discipline and resourcefulness .

maintainable code. My strategic thinking skills help me to plant and prioritise my work, ensuring that I deliver a highquality software on time.
* Agile development: I have a deep understanding of the agile development methodology, having worked on several
engineering projects during the course. I am comfortable working in an agile environment, collaborating with team
members, and delivering value to end-user in an iterative and incremental manner.
* Leadership: Using my exceptional soft skills, I am confident in leading stand-ups, retrospectives, and projects
presentations. I have experience in managing teams, communicating effectively, and driving the project to success.
